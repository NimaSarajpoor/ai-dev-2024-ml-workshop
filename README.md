# Deploy and Monitor ML Pipelines with Open Source and Free Applications

Materials for the **Deploy and Monitor ML Pipelines with Open Source and Free Applications** workshop at the [AI_dev 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/ai-dev-europe/) conference in Paris, France.

When ðŸ“†: Wednesday, June 19th, 13:50 CEST

The workshop will focus on different deployment designs of machine learning pipelines using open-source applications and free-tier tools. We will use the US hourly demand for electricity data from the EIA API to demonstrate the deployment of a pipeline with GitHub Actions and Docker that fully automates the data refresh process and generates a forecast on a regular basis. This includes the use of open-source tools such as MLflow and YData Profiling to monitor the health of the data and the model's success. Last but not least, we will use Quarto doc to set up the monitoring dashboard and deploy it on GitHub Pages.
